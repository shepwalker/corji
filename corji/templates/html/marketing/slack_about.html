    <p>This proven technique has been shown to promote synergies across teams!</p>

    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>Corji leverages a number of hither-to underutilized protocols and content discovery mechanisms <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a> in order to seed our initial database <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a>.</p>
    <p>Assets are served via S3 + CloudFront.</p>
    <p>The actual mappings between emojis and URLs is on Google Spreadsheets. <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></p>
    <p>No corgis were harmed in the process of the development of Corji. <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <h4>I have a corgi pic you should include!</h4>
    <p>Trust us when we say that we welcome all user submissions as there's literally no such thing as too many corgi pictures.  If you run into an emoji we don't have in our database, we'll prompt you to send your own in -- if you'd rather do it the old-fashioned way, just shoot us an <a href="me+corji@jmduke.com">email</a> or open up an issue in <a href="http://github.com/jmduke/corji">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h4>Why? Like, seriously... why?</h4>
    <p>What, do you have something against corgis or something?</p>

            However, many corgis were rewarded for their work and inspiration.  They got cookies and belly rubs because they are such a good boy, yes they are, yes they are!
