        <h2>A distributed, resilient, highly available <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a> CDN <a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a> using SMS as a transport layer.</h2>

        <h2 id="number">+16693420943</h2>

        <h3>What it does</h3>
        <p>See that phone number up there?  The green one?</p>
        <p>Text it an emoji <a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a>, like: </p>
        <p>üèÄ</p>
        <p>And we'll send you back a corgi!  Like:</p>
        <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/6b/bf/37/6bbf3751b876a4dbdf73ff3f6ac3d3e2.jpg">
        <p>Yup.  It's pretty great.  Some might even call it disruptive.</p>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>Corji leverages a number of hither-to underutilized protocols and content discovery mechanisms <a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a> in order to seed our initial database <a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a>.</p>
        <p>The actual SMS heavy lifting is handled by <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a>, with the TwiML being served Flask on EC2 hosts.</p>
        <p>Assets are served via S3 + CloudFront.</p>
        <p>The actual mappings between emojis and URLs is on Google Spreadsheets. <a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></p>
        <p>No corgis were harmed in the process of the development of Corji. <a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>

        <h4>I have a corgi pic you should include!</h4>
        <p>Trust us when we say that we welcome all user submissions as there's literally no such thing as too many corgi pictures.  If you run into an emoji we don't have in our database, we'll prompt you to send your own in -- if you'd rather do it the old-fashioned way, just shoot us an <a href="me+corji@jmduke.com">email</a> or open up an issue in <a href="http://github.com/jmduke/corji">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h4>Why? Like, seriously... why?</h4>
        <p>What, do you have something against corgis or something?</p>

                However, many corgis were rewarded for their work and inspiration.  They got cookies and belly rubs because they are such a good boy, yes they are, yes they are!

                Note that it has to be an actual emoji, not just a picture of an emoji.  Don't pull a <a href="https://twitter.com/paulpierce34/status/618860245025030144?lang=en">Paul Pierce</a>.
